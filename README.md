This event-driven application was made for a client that needed to be able to insert real estate data on houses into a DynamoDB table automatically and perform various actions on the data. The InsertDataToDynamoDBFunction function is triggered by an S3 putObject event. After it is invoked it retrieves the newly inserted item from S3, which is this case is a CSV file containing data on houses, and inserts the data as items into the RealEstateDataTable as one house per item. (All functions that start with an HTTP verb are invoked by an HTTP request of that type from APIGateway) The GetActiveHouseFunction and GetSoldHouseFunction, allow the user to query the table for the respective house by providing either the MLS# for the house or the address. The GetListingTypeFunction allows the user to provide an address or MLS# and be returned whether the house is active or sold. The GetAllHousesFromDateFunction allows the user to provide a date and be returned the addresses of all the houses added on that date. The Monthly and Weekly Invoke functions are invoked by a respective cron job scheduled EventBride rule, then they send the user the average active listing price and average sell price for the respective time frame using SES.
